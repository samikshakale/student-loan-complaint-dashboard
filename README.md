# student-loan-complaint-dashboard
A powerful BI interactive dashboard to visualize student loan complaint metrics by location, issue, company and more.
## Background
Student loan complaints have risen over the last couple of years. Furthermore, new policies, such as loan forgiveness programs, cause confusion among student borrowers. The Consumer Financial Proection Bureau (CFPB) tracks complaints across a variety of loans, including student loans, and has a rich database of information. This dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for understanding this data.
## Dashboard Interactivity
- Top Right: sliding bar to select the date range from which to show complaints
- Complaints by State: select a state to filter the rest of the dashboard according to the metrics for that state
- % Company Response: click on a slice from the pie chart to view the percentage and count of complaints for that category
## How to Use
Download the `Student Loan Dashboard.twbx` file and you can access it using your Tableau Public account and view on Tableau Desktop.
